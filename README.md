ðŸ“Š Data Analysis Projects â€“ Internship at Unified Mentor. These projects were developed as part of my Data Analyst Internship at Unified Mentor. They involve detailed analysis, visualization, and predictive modeling using three distinct tools: SQL, Python, and Tableau.

Furniture Sales Dataset â€“ Focused on uncovering insights related to sales performance, customer trends, and regional profitability, along with building a predictive model to forecast future sales.

Olympic Dataset â€“ Explores patterns in athlete performance, country-wise medal distribution, and historical trends across Olympic Games, using visualizations and data-driven storytelling.

These projects demonstrate my ability to clean and analyze data, build predictive models in Python, and present insights through interactive Tableau dashboards.
